# 0x03. Responsive Design

## Description
This project involves building a responsive website using HTML and CSS. The main focus is on implementing mobile-first design principles and making use of media queries to create layouts that adapt seamlessly across various devices.

The wireframe provided is for the mobile version of the **Techium** project, and the site must be responsive for both desktop and mobile views.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts:
- **Mobile-first design**: The strategy of designing for mobile devices first and then enhancing the design for larger screens.
- **Media queries**: Techniques used to apply different styles depending on the device's characteristics (e.g., screen width).
- **Responsive web design**: Adapting the layout to look good on all devices (desktops, tablets, and phones).
- **Differences between responsive and adaptive design**.
- **CSS units for flexibility**: Including percentages, viewport units (vh, vw), em, rem, and others.

## Requirements
- Use HTML and CSS.
- Render correctly in Chrome version 78 or higher.
- Include a `README.md` at the root of the project.
- Wireframe for the mobile version should match the design.
- Place all images in the `images/` directory.
  
## Project Structure
The project consists of the following files:

- **00-index.html**: The HTML file containing the main structure of the website.
- **00-styles.css**: The CSS file responsible for styling the HTML elements and ensuring the design is responsive.
